  dialogues:
  - Where did I come from? Lands as hot as the equator? Speak demon. Did the one
    in the boat fool me? He said he was sailing with a stop at the Pantheon. Put
    this table down, you bastard. I'll demand it or proceed to kill you.
  - You are a guy who knows what he's talking about. I see you know who I am and
    my importance. And anyone who treats me below those levels... send them to the
    guillotine.
  - Speak to me as if I were your father. Well, I'm not. Shall I call in the executioners
    or shall I proceed my self with the bloodiest execution you've ever experienced?
    I hate anyone who can't address me as "the very great Emperor of France".
  - The way you talk... I feel offended. The indifference is irritating and agonising.
    Your height... YOUR HEIGHT AND HOW YOU SHOW YOURSELF INDIFFERENT TO MINE... I'll
    kill you if you don't get down on your knees!
  - OH! HOW DARE YOU. You think you're... *Cof* You can't treat me like that... *Maybe
    you can...* Continuing. If the King of Portugal had treated me like this instead
    of strategically retreating to Brazil, I wouldn't have invaded the country twice
    more.
  - "AH! YES! PLEASE. KEEP IT UP. REMIND ME WHEN I ASKED MARIA LU\xCDSA TO INSULT
    ME LIKE THAT and hit me..."
  - How dare you ignore me! Do you want me to shove a baguette up your ass?!
  - I'll send hordes of soldiers to your door and then you'll know who's coming "El
    mui grandioso imperador de France...
