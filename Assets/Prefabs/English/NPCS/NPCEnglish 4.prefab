  dialogues:
  - Where are the Castilians? I'm short of sausage for my bread.
  - Yes, yes! This technique of swinging the bread shovel has been honed over the
    years within my family. It's been many years of giving the Castilians a hard
    time.
  - I don't fight for God, only for my land and my bread. There is no cow that coughs
    in my field without being afraid of me. There's not a Castilian who steps on
    the land here who doesn't get slapped with six fingers.
  - The other day I was told to donate some grain to the saints, but I thought it
    would be better to save it in case we suffered another invasion and I had to
    survive another siege.
  - You talk dirty as if you were kneading bread in the same bakery as me. I won't
    tolerate it. I won't let you steal our demo lands!
  - AI! Let me find an oven to heat up the shovel so you don't regret what you're
    calling me. That pair of horns will serve you well.
  - Don't you understand my language? You must be one of those from Castile, should
    I put a spade in it to make myself understood?
  - I've got to get back to my bakery, God knows how many loaves of bread the punks
    have taken from me on credit.
