  dialogues:
  - Damn that horse that sent me to the ground, I could never again chastise the
    Moors in the name of God and the holy light.
  - My strength comes from the Father of all in heaven, if his praise must be directed
    to them, I believe it should be to him.
  - I'd like to meet my father after all these years, tell him about how I conquered
    his dream. And also confess for what I did to my mother.
  - Can you tell me where my father went? Henry of Burgundy. He was also a great
    knight who fought for the Cross of Christ to reconquer the lost lands in Lusitania.
  - I thought he was a respectful person for being on this side of life, but it turns
    out I was wrong.
  - What are you insulting me for? Are you trying to incite my hatred for futile
    reasons? The priest said that the beings of the abyss tempt us to evil. I only
    raise my sword towards the Moors and those who threaten the existence of Portugal.
  - Please don't ignore me. I just want to go on to the other side destined by God.
  - I hope that the Portuguese of today are at peace and looking after themselves
    and their neighbours.
